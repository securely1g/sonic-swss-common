# Generated runtime package metadata

`//:runtime_packages.json` is generated from this repository's existing
`debian/control` and `debian/changelog`, the package-to-TAR mapping in
`BUILD.bazel`, and the exact source-built runtime payloads. Change package names,
descriptions and explicit dependency policy in the Debian files; there is no
second checked-in copy of those fields.

The shared `runtime_packages` rule computes shared-library dependencies from the
selected payloads and their declared source/APT dependency metadata. Its output
also carries the package owner's public runtime target. The consuming OCI rule
checks that target, hashes the actual TAR and reads the selected module version
for source provenance. Architecture and feature selection follow the Bazel
configuration. Unresolved dependency substitutions fail the build.

The rule generates metadata and library dependency information only. It does
not build Debian packages, run package installation scripts, or change the
legacy Make package recipes.

Build the metadata with `bazel build //:runtime_packages.json`. Native CI builds
this target alongside the corresponding runtime TARs.

## Required package files

The producer declares its required paths in `BUILD.bazel`, next to the
package-to-TAR mapping. The metadata action checks those paths in the built
runtime TAR before emitting metadata. For example, a TAR missing
`usr/lib/{multiarch}/libswsscommon.so.0` fails even if the library compiled.
`{multiarch}` resolves to the selected AMD64 or ARM64 library directory.

Common owns the library names, Python extension, CLI and canonical
`run/redis/sonic-db/database_config.json` path. The runtime TAR supplies Lua
scripts and database configuration as root-owned `0644` data files, so images
can consume them without fixing permissions or rewriting the configuration path.
Its package test checks raw TAR ownership and data modes and compares the
installed database configuration with `common/database_config.json`.
The base image's existing `/var/run -> /run` link preserves access for callers
using `/var/run`; the TAR does not replace that link or change legacy Debian
packaging.
